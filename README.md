# Unexpected Null Behavior in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in JavaScript related to null checks and type coercion. The `foo` function includes a check for `null` values using strict equality (`===`). However, this check might not behave as expected in certain situations.  The provided `bug.js` illustrates the issue, while `bugSolution.js` shows a corrected version that addresses the potential problem.  The main issue is with loose type checking and how null and undefined interact with ===.  Strict equality requires both type and value to match.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` using a JavaScript environment.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior related to null values.
4. Compare it against the corrected behavior provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Solution
The solution involves understanding and addressing Javascript's type coercion and behavior with null and undefined. The code in `bugSolution.js` enhances the null checks to handle various edge cases and ensure the function behaves predictably across different input types.
